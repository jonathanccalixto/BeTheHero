## Project splited

This project was initially conceived as a monorepo, but in order to make it easier to deploy, I thought it best to divide it into 3 parts: backend, frontend and mobile.

### Backen, Documentation, Frontend and Mobile
- The backend folder has been moved to the repository: [BeTheHero-backtend](https://github.com/jonathanccalixto/BeTheHero-backend)
- The documentation folder has been moved into the backend project as docs
- The frontend folder has been moved to the repository: [BeTheHero-frontend](https://github.com/jonathanccalixto/BeTheHero-frontend)
- The mobile folder has been moved to the repository: [BeTheHero-mobile](https://github.com/jonathanccalixto/BeTheHero-mobil)
